Dear \StudyAuthor:


Attached you will find an approval for your request to extend and modify your research study in
Pasco County Schools entitled ``\Study.'' As per district procedures, teacher
participants are not to receive compensation individually but may receive compensation to a
school account for the teacher's classroom.

The purpose of your study is to find out what is the best type of training to teach school staff
how to use data to adapt interventions for students with behavioral and emotional concerns.

Your Pasco County Schools' contact person is Vicki Papaemanuel, Supervisor, Office for Student
Support Programs and Services.

We are always interested in the outcome of research conducted in our school system. When
your study is complete, please forward a brief summary of your findings to the Office for
Accountability, Research, and Measurement.

Best of luck as you pursue the subject of your research.

Sincerely,

\bigskip
