## Collection of Pasco County Schools Document Templates for R

These templates use a combination of R, LaTeX, and reveal.js to create templates for my work at Pasco County Schools. They are not guaranteed to work out-of-the-box for any use; rather, these are examples taht others can use to create their own documents.
